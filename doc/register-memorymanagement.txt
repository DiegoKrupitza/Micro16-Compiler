When there is no space in the registers and there is a need for space, you have to free up some space.
The strategy here is to use a queue. After each new variable use, it gets added to the queue.
When there is no space in the registers, the oldest variable gets outsourced.
Because of that strategy its only posible to use up to 10 differnt var at the same time
Newest variable is the first one
Oldest variable is the last one


Memory Access:
By default the Compiler accesses up to 255 memory addresses. In case more than 255 addresses are needed (for example in heavy
load applications) you can expand that range, but its not that recommended.
