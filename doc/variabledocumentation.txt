In this language there are five ways to define a variable:
1. var [variableName] = [value]
2. var [variableName] = [value1] [operation] [value2]
3. var [variableName] = [variableName]
4. var [variableName] = [variableName1] [operation] [variableName2]
5. var [variableName] = [variableName1] [operation] [value]
