# Introduction
Every student at TU Wien learns in the first semester in the course "Technical Basics of Computer Science" about a self design CPU called *Micro16*. The instruction set of the Micro16 CPU is quite limited and all the registers are just 16 bits (so a good CPU to start). After a little bit of research I found out that there is no High Language available that compiles to *Micro16*. That is the reason why I started the **Micro16-Compiler** project. 

# About the language
The language is quite similar to Python and Java. The aim of that language is to be as simple as possible and to work efficiently on the Micro16 CPU. The interpreter of that language is implemented in Java.


# Sonarcloud
For quality improvement and static code analysis Sonar cloud is used. At the current state of the project the focus is on *Bugs* and on *Code Smells*. At later point there will be more tests included!
